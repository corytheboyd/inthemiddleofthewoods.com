## What is the deal?

As you may have heard, Cory and Jammie recently bought a house in the Colorado mountains, and have become crazy mountain people.

You heard right!

## Follow the journey

We're always in the middle of one or two projects. When they go well, we'll write about them!

You can find such updates in [the Posts section](/posts). 

## Pretty pictures

Snowy mountains, budding trees, fluffy deer, and other such displays of nature are in no shortage up here.

You can find our pretty pictures [in the Gallery](/pictures).

## Come stay with us

We would absolutely **LOVE** to have you come stay with us. Come by yourself, bring the whole family-- we just want to see happy faces in our home, leave the accommodations to us!

If you're interested, check out [the Stay page](/stay) for details.
